        <div class="card" id="card1">
        <p>Memory has long been a favorite game for all generations. It is easy to play, in fact it is so simple that really young children can play with ease.

          It requires observation, concentration and a good memory to win.
          
          Although the game is designed so two players play against each other it can also be played by a single player.
          
          The game is also known as Concentration, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso and Pairs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" id="card2">
          <p>The first player chooses a card and carefully turns it over. Be sure not to bother the surrounding cards.

            The player then selects another card and turns it over. If the two cards are a matching pair for example two Jacks then they take the two cards and start a stack. The player is awarded another turn for making a match and goes again.
            
            If the cards are not a match they are turned back over and it is now the next players turn.
            
            The next player chooses their first card and turns it over. If it is a match for one of the cards the previous player turned over then they try to remember where that matching card was and turn it. If they are successful at making a match they place the cards in their stack and choose another card.
            
            If the first card turned over was not a match for one previously turned over the player selects another card in an attempt of making a pair.
            
            If they are unsuccessful in making a match they flip the cards back over and play is passed to the next player.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" id="card3">
          <p>A players turn is not over until they are unable to make a matching pair.

              The game continues in this fashion until all the cards are played.</p>
